# Anagnorisis — User Configuration
# =============================================================================
# 
# Copy this file to create your configuration:
#
#   cp docker-compose.override.example.yaml docker-compose.override.yaml
#
# Then edit docker-compose.override.yaml with your actual folder paths.
# After that, start the application as usual:
#
#   docker compose up -d
#
# Docker Compose automatically merges this file with docker-compose.yaml.
# You only need to edit this file once. After that, just use:
#
#   docker compose up -d     (to start)
#   docker compose down      (to stop)
