# Classic Italian Recipes

## Authentic Pasta Carbonara
*Preparation time: 30 minutes*
*Serves: 4*

Carbonara is a traditional Roman pasta dish known for its creamy sauce made from egg, hard cheese, cured pork, and black pepper.

### Ingredients:
- 350g spaghetti or rigatoni
- 150g pancetta or guanciale, diced
- 4 large egg yolks
- 2 large whole eggs
- 100g Pecorino Romano cheese, freshly grated
- 50g Parmigiano Reggiano, freshly grated
- Freshly ground black pepper
- Salt for pasta water

### Instructions:
1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook until al dente.
2. While pasta is cooking, heat a large, deep skillet over medium heat. Add the pancetta and sauté until crispy, about 5-7 minutes.
3. In a bowl, whisk together egg yolks, whole eggs, and grated cheeses. Season with black pepper.
4. Reserve 1 cup of pasta cooking water, then drain the pasta.
5. With the skillet off the heat, add the hot pasta to the pancetta. Toss quickly to coat in the fat.
6. Add the egg mixture to the pasta, stirring continuously to prevent scrambling. Add a splash of reserved pasta water to achieve a creamy consistency.
7. Serve immediately with extra grated cheese and black pepper.

**Note:** The heat from the pasta cooks the egg sauce, but it shouldn't be too hot or the eggs will scramble instead of creating a creamy coating.

## Homemade Margherita Pizza
*Preparation time: 2 hours (including dough rising)*
*Serves: 2-3*

The classic Margherita showcases the colors of the Italian flag: red (tomato), white (mozzarella), and green (basil).

### Ingredients:
#### For the dough:
- 500g "00" flour or all-purpose flour
- 325ml warm water
- 7g active dry yeast
- 10g salt
- 15ml olive oil

#### For the topping:
- 400g San Marzano tomatoes, crushed
- 250g fresh mozzarella, torn into pieces
- Fresh basil leaves
- Extra virgin olive oil
- Salt to taste

### Instructions:
1. Dissolve yeast in warm water and let sit for 5 minutes until foamy.
2. In a large bowl, combine flour and salt. Make a well in the center and add the yeast mixture and olive oil.
3. Mix until a dough forms, then knead on a floured surface for 10 minutes until smooth and elastic.
4. Place dough in an oiled bowl, cover, and let rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours until doubled in size.
5. Preheat your oven to the highest temperature (ideally 500°F/260°C) with a pizza stone or inverted baking sheet inside.
6. Divide dough into 2-3 balls. Stretch each into a 10-12 inch round.
7. Top with crushed tomatoes, mozzarella, and a drizzle of olive oil.
8. Bake for 8-10 minutes until crust is golden and cheese is bubbling.
9. Remove from the oven, top with fresh basil leaves, and serve immediately.

**Tip:** For an authentic taste, use a pizza stone and let it preheat in the oven for at least 30 minutes before baking.
